Chef Script for amoschan.com
============================

This script will provision the server that runs my personal blog.

The blogs are static sites that are generated by [Ignoramos][i] and synced via
Dropbox.

[i]: http://github.com/achan/ignoramos

This has been tested to run on the following Digital Ocean droplet:

 - 512MB Ram
 - Ubuntu 14.04 x64

Simply create the droplet and run the following command:

```bash
./setup_vps.sh deploy $droplet_ip
```

Where `$droplet_ip` is the IP of the droplet that was created.

After the droplet has been provisioned, you'll need to login as `deploy` and
install Dropbox with the script provided:

```bash
~/bin/install_dropbox.sh
```

This script will install Dropbox and walk you through linking the server to your
Dropbox account.

```bash
~/bin/setup_dropbox.sh
```

This script will:

 - Selectively sync ~/Dropbox/Sites
 - Symlink the static sites to the folders Nginx expects to serve them from

After Dropbox is installed, restart Nginx and you should be good to go!

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

This web server uses Nginx to serve two static sites:

 - amoschan.com is served at /home/deploy/apps/amoschan
 - badchristian.amoschan.com is served at /home/deploy/apps/badchristian

Both folders are symlinked from ~/Dropbox/Sites, which is synced via Dropbox.
